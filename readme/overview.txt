Use paid AI tools — without worrying about payments or clients.
Some AI tools cost money.
Some AI clients support payments.
Most don’t.
via402 removes that friction.
You connect via402 once and get access to a curated set of MCP tools — some free, some paid — all behind a single endpoint.
Pick the tools you want, define how much you’re willing to spend, and ignore the rest.
After that, you can use paid and free MCP tools from any AI client as if they were native.
via402 takes care of the payment flow behind the scenes.





FlowMCP standardizes how AI interacts with APIs using schema-based contracts and includes tools to define and test them.
